ReactJS Modern UI Website

Project Name: Destinize

Project Description:
It's a traveling brochure for Indonesia. This is a modern ui application made with ReactJS.

Technologies Used:
React,
CSS Modules,
React Icons,
Figma (Website Design)

Why This Project:
I created This project to establish the basics knowledge I have of React. This project shows that I can take a design and turn it into a functioning website. Although the website is mostly static, the real objective was to be able to make a website look exactly like the design.

What I learned:
-How to use and utilize React Icons.Those icons really come in handy.
-I learned how to use CSS modules. Honestly, I think CSS modules are cool for preventing style clashing, but when it comes to responsive development, it's not a good tool to use, hints why my website is not responsive.

What I hope to improve:
-Honestly, I would have to learn another method besides CSS modules, or maybe continue using the BEM model.
